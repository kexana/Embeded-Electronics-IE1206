Course lab assignments and reports

*IE1206 VT24 Embeded Electronics at KTH during ICT bsc*

In this course we learn about electrical circuits and the function of the basic components in electrical circuits. We learn to analyze time independent as well as time dependent circuits. This course provides basic knowledge of circuit theory and electronics. It also provides knowledge of the various devices that can be found in a microcontroller and how these are supposed to be used. The course gives a solid ground for future studies within electronics.
